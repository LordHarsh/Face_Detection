# Face_Detection

This is just for fun so do not start getting your hope ups, but its worth giving a try.

If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks then open the notebook from the button given below and see this step by step guide-
* When notebook opens, click on ```Runtime``` and select ```Run all```.
> Each box appearing in the workspace is known as a cell. This option will rull all cells one by one.
* If you want to rull each cell manually use ```ctrl+Enter```.
* When this is done, you will see two forms at the end.
* First form is to enter a person's picture in database. You can do this by entering the URL (image address) of a image or by uploading the picture from your local PC. You also have to enter name of person so it can be saved in the database.
> **Note-** Make sure there is a ```http``` or ```https``` in the URL.
* Second form is where it tries to recognize the person. Here, you have have to enter the URL of image or just upload it.
